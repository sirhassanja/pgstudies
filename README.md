Resulting digital resources arising from PhD research work towards addressing the problem of intellectual resource documentation. 
The documented studies on classical Ifẹ̀ sculptural artefacts are often narrated in English. 
Such narratives make developing a digital repository for intellectual resource documentation of these images a difficult task. 
There is need to engage the question of the theoretical formulation of a computational framework for the description of these artefacts.
The need is motivated with a view to giving expression to them; hence, this study.
